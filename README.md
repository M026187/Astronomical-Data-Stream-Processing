Scenario:
You have accepted the role of a Mid-Level Programmer for CITE Managed Services. Your task is to design, code and test a series of algorthms. You will demonstrate your programming knowledge by producing a program that will process astronomical data streamed from a local observatory. The continuous data represents the interaction of the neutrinos with earth matter, which are amplified and stored in an array data structure for analysis.

Software Development Methodology:
This individual project will use an agile methodology to complete the development of the Astronomical Processing application. There are three major milestones, Sprint One, Sprint Two and Handover.

Sprint 1:
At the local observatory the number of neutrino interactions per hour is saved as an integer value. The client wants to record and process these hourly values by storing them in an array of size 24. They require a forms-based GUI application which displays the data in a list box and uses text boxes and buttons for processing.

Client Requirements:
All data is stored as integers in an array
The client can use a text box input to search the data
There are buttons that can sort and search the data
There is an input field (text box) so data can be edited
The name of the application should be Astronomical Processing

Program Functionality:
The array is of type integer
The array has 24 elements to reflect the number of hours per day
The sort method must be coded using the Bubble Sort algorithm
The search method must be coded using the Binary Search algorithm
A single text box is provided for the search input
The program must generate an error message if the text box is empty
The program must generate and error message if the search is no successful
The program must generate a message if the search is successful
The program must be able to edit data values
The array is filled with random integers to simulate the data stream (numbers between 10 and 90)

Project Management and Source Control:
Source control facility to save, edit and review the documents and programming code -> GitHub
Use the GitHub Project Board to manage workflows (Sprints)
The Scrum Master is responsible for managing the GitHub Project each week
Complete the Sprint One information with tasks for each weeks and save a screen capture of your GitHub Project with associate notes

Application and GUI Prototype Design:
Review the Sprint One Client Requirements and Program Functionality
Using this information, design a user interface that would be suitable for this application
Design, write, and review the algorithm and pseudo code for the two majoy processing functions required by the Client (Binary Search and Bubble Sort)
