# Astronomical Data Stream Processing

Scenario:
You have accepted the role of a Mid-Level Programmer for CITE Managed Services. Your task is to design, code and test a series of algorthms. You will demonstrate your programming knowledge by producing a program that will process astronomical data streamed from a local observatory. The continuous data represents the interaction of the neutrinos with earth matter, which are amplified and stored in an array data structure for analysis.

Software Development Methodology:
This individual project will use an agile methodology to complete the development of the Astronomical Processing application. There are three major milestones, Sprint One, Sprint Two and Handover.

## Sprint 1:
At the local observatory the number of neutrino interactions per hour is saved as an integer value. The client wants to record and process these hourly values by storing them in an array of size 24. They require a forms-based GUI application which displays the data in a list box and uses text boxes and buttons for processing.

### Client Requirements:
* All data is stored as integers in an array
* The client can use a text box input to search the data
* There are buttons that can sort and search the data
* There is an input field (text box) so data can be edited
* The name of the application should be Astronomical Processing

## Sprint 2:
Following the success of Sprint One the client has requested several modifications and additions to the Astronomical Processing Application. The client would like serveral buttons to perform mathematical calculations on the data set. Furthermore, the client would like to add a sequential search option.

### Client Requirements:
* A button to calculate the mid-extreme
* A button to calculate the mode
* A button to calculate the average
* A button to calculate the range
* All GUI components have detailed tool tips
* A button to initiate a sequential search
